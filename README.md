## Description

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

- Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.

- There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.

- The final two columns ending with "adj" show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time
